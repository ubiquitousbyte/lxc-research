abstract = {The common perception in both academic literature and industry today is that virtual machines offer better security, whereas containers offer better performance. However, a detailed review of the history of these technologies and the current threats they face reveals a different story. This survey covers key developments in the evolution of virtual machines and containers from the 1950s to today, with an emphasis on countering modern misperceptions with accurate historical details and providing a solid foundation for ongoing research into the future of secure isolation for multitenant infrastructures, such as cloud and container deployments.},

abstract = {With serverless computing, providers deploy application code and manage resource allocation dynamically, eliminating infrastructure management from application development.Serverless providers have a variety of virtualization platforms to choose from for isolating functions, ranging from native Linux processes to Linux containers to lightweight isolation platforms, such as Google gVisor [7] and AWS Firecracker [5]. These platforms form a spectrum as they move functionality out of the host kernel and into an isolated guest environment. For example, gVisor handles many system calls in a user-mode Sentry process while Firecracker runs a full guest operating system in each microVM. A common theme across these platforms are the twin goals of strong isolation and high performance.In this paper, we perform a comparative study of Linux containers (LXC), gVisor secure containers, and Firecracker microVMs to understand how they use Linux kernel services differently: how much does their use of host kernel functionality vary? We also evaluate the performance costs of the designs with a series of microbenchmarks targeting different kernel subsystems.Our results show that despite moving much functionality out of the kernel, both Firecracker and gVisor execute substantially more kernel code than native Linux. gVisor and Linux containers execute substantially the same code, although with different frequency.},

abstract = {Supercomputing centers are seeing increasing demand for user-defined software stacks (UDSS), instead of or in addition to the stack provided by the center. These UDSS support user needs such as complex dependencies or build requirements, externally required configurations, portability, and consistency. The challenge for centers is to provide these services in a usable manner while minimizing the risks: security, support burden, missing functionality, and performance. We present Charliecloud, which uses the Linux user and mount namespaces to run industry-standard Docker containers with no privileged operations or daemons on center resources. Our simple approach avoids most security risks while maintaining access to the performance and functionality already on offer, doing so in just 800 lines of code. Charliecloud promises to bring an industry-standard UDSS user workflow to existing, minimally altered HPC resources.},
