\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}
The results presented in the previous chapter show that the isolation overhead 
of process containerisation is negligible. Disk latencies and throughput measurements 
in containers are on par with the same measurements on the host, making containers 
favourable for tight consolidation of multiple applications on a single server.
The networking infrastructure required to enable inter-container communication may lead to 
packet loss, higher retransmission counts and therefore increased latencies and decreased throughput.
Nevertheless, the average latency and throughput over the lifespan of a workload are almost
equivalent to running the application on the host. Furthermore, it is shown that 
hardware virtualisation mechanisms impact the resulting latencies and throughput far more 
severely \cite{https://doi.org/10.1002/cpe.5693} \cite{8457798}.
