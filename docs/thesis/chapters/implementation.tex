\chapter{Implementation}
This chapter focuses on the implementation details of the container runtime 
and the benchmark tool. 

Section \ref{ch:implementation/runtime} dives deeply into the 
system call interface of the Linux kernel that enables the creation and execution 
of isolated workloads. The actions taken by the runtime 
to ensure proper noninterference are also discussed.
